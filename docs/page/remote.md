# Remote

## TRAMP

LSP mode has support for tramp buffers with the following requirements:

- The language server has to be present on the remote server.
- Having multi folder language server (like [Eclipse JDT LS](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls)) cannot have local and remote workspace folders.

### How does it work?

`lsp-mode` detects whether a particular file is located on remote machine and looks for a client which matches current file and it is marked as `:remote?` t. Then `lsp-mode` starts the client through tramp.

### Sample configuration

Here it is example how you can configure python language server to work when using `TRAMP`. Note that if you are trying to convert existing language server configuration you should copy all of it's properties(e. g. `:request-handlers`, `activation-fn`, etc).

```elisp
(lsp-register-client
    (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-tramp-connection "<insert your LS's binary name or path here>")
                     :major-modes '(python-mode)
                     :remote? t
                     :server-id 'pyls-remote))
```

_Note:_ the path passed to `lsp-tramp-connection` should be either full path including host name, e. g. `/docker:my-image:/usr/bin/rust-analyzer` or the binary name (e. g. `rust-analyzer`) if the binary is on the path.

### Dealing with stderr

With TRAMP, Emacs does not have an easy way to distinguish stdout and stderr, so when the underlying LSP process writes to stderr, it breaks the `lsp-mode` parser. As a workaround, `lsp-mode` is redirecting stderr to `/tmp/<process-name>-<id>~stderr`.


## Docker

Refer to [lsp-docker](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-docker/) README which provides a guide on how you can run `lsp-mode` in `docker` container.
